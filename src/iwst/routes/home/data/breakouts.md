## Lower Hemisphere Polar Plots
**Lower hemisphere polar plots** are a graphical tool to evaluate **borehole stability** as a function of wellbore inclination and azimuth under different in-situ stress regimes. Each point on the plot represents a possible wellbore orientation: **vertical wells** correspond to a point in the center, **horizontal wells** correspond to a point on the periphery at the appropriate azimuth and **deviated wells** are plotted at the appropriate azimuth and radial distance.  
They help visualize mechanical stability indicators, such as **required rock strength** or **required mud pressure**, as a function of wellbore trajectory. This allows to identify **optimal drilling directions** and mitigate risks such as wellbore collapse or tensile fracturing.  
The interpretation of these plots depends on the **tectonic stress regime**, normal, strike-slip, or reverse, which defines the relative magnitudes and directions of the principal stresses: the vertical stress (Sv), the maximum horizontal stress (SHmax), and the minimum horizontal stress (Shmin). These principal stresses govern the distribution of stress around the borehole wall, and thus the required conditions to maintain stability change significantly depending on the regime.
  
## Breakouts Polar Plot
**Breakouts** occur when the **compressive stresses** around the wellbore **exceed** the **rock strength**. These failures typically manifest in the **direction** of the minimum horizontal stress (**Shmin**), as the maximum tangential stress concentrates perpendicular to the maximum horizontal stress (SHmax).  
The **Breakouts Polar Plot** displays the **required unconfined compressive strength** (UCS) to **prevent** the initiation of breakouts. The UCS values are calculated based on the local stress distribution around the borehole for each orientation, incorporating principal stresses (SHmax, Shmin, Sv), pore pressure (Pp), and mud pressure (Pmud).      
The color scale shows how the required UCS varies with wellbore inclination and azimuth: **red** colors represent relatively **unstable well** orientations as higher rock strength is required to prevent breakout initiation whereas dark **blue** represents **relatively stable well** orientations as failure is prevented by much lower rock strength.
