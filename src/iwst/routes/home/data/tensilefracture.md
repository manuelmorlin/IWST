## Lower Hemisphere Polar Plots
**Lower hemisphere polar plots** are a graphical tool to evaluate **borehole stability** as a function of wellbore inclination and azimuth under different in-situ stress regimes. Each point on the plot represents a possible wellbore orientation: **vertical wells** correspond to a point in the center, **horizontal wells** correspond to a point on the periphery at the appropriate azimuth and **deviated wells** are plotted at the appropriate azimuth and radial distance.  
They help visualize mechanical stability indicators, such as **required rock strength** or **required mud pressure**, as a function of wellbore trajectory. This allows to identify **optimal drilling directions** and mitigate risks such as wellbore collapse or tensile fracturing.  
The interpretation of these plots depends on the **tectonic stress regime**, normal, strike-slip, or reverse, which defines the relative magnitudes and directions of the principal stresses: the vertical stress (Sv), the maximum horizontal stress (SHmax), and the minimum horizontal stress (Shmin). These principal stresses govern the distribution of stress around the borehole wall, and thus the required conditions to maintain stability change significantly depending on the regime.

## Tensile Fracture Polar Plot
**Tensile fractures** occur when the **pressure** inside the borehole becomes high enough to **overcome** the **tensile strength of the rock**, leading to tensile failure. This typically happens when the mud pressure exceeds the minimum principal stress acting perpendicular to the borehole wall. **Tensile** **fractures** develop **perpendicular** to the direction of the least principal stress (**Shmin**).  
The **Tensile Fracture Polar Plot** illustrates the **required mud pressure** (Pmud)  to **initiate** tensile failure for all possible wellbore orientations. In this case, the color scale represents the critical Pmud needed to exceed the least principal stress and initiate tensile failure: **red** corresponds to orientations where **tensile fractures are more likely**, as only a small increase in mud pressure is needed to induce failure; **blue** indicates **relatively stable well** as high mud weight is required.
