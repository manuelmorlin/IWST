## Borehole Stress Plot
The **Borehole Stress Plot** shows the **variation** of **radial** (σrr) and **tangential** (σθθ) **stresses** as a function of the azimuthal angle **around the borehole wall**. These stresses can be calculated for any inclination and azimuth of the well, making these plots useful for both **vertical** and **deviated wells**. By accounting for the borehole's orientation relative to the in-situ stress field, these models help predict where stress concentrations are most likely to cause mechanical failure.    
The x-axis represents the angle around the borehole wall, measured from the south (0° to 360°), while the y-axis shows the stress magnitude at the borehole wall (in MPa).  
The curves correspond to the principal stress components at the borehole wall:
- σθθ (tangential or hoop stress) – stress acting circumferentially around the wellbore.  
- σzz (axial stress) – stress parallel to the borehole axis.  
- Maximum tangential stress.  
- Minimum tangential stress.  

**Tangential stress** is a key indicator of potential **wellbore failure**. **Peaks in σθθ** represent regions of **high** compressive tangential stress, often aligned with Shmin direction. If σθθ exceeds the rock compressive strength, **breakouts** may form there.
**Troughs in σθθ** indicate **low** (or tensile) tangential stress. If this stress drops below the tensile strength of the rock (or becomes positive), **tensile fractures** may initiate along the SHmax direction.  
This type of stress distribution plot is commonly used in **wellbore stability** analysis to assess how the rock around the borehole will respond to in-situ stresses and drilling conditions. By showing how the tangential stress varies around the wellbore wall, it allows to identify **critical directions** where the rock is most likely to **fail**.  
These plots are important for determining **safe mud weights** during drilling: a pressure that is too low can cause breakouts, while a pressure that is too high can induce tensile fractures.  

## Mohr-Coulomb Plot
The **Mohr-Coulomb Plot** shows the three principal stresses (tangential, axial and radial) at the wellbore wall at the **point** of **maximum stress concentration** shown as a three-dimensional Mohr diagram.  
The black line is the **Mohr-Coulomb failure envelope**, which defines the limit beyond which the rock is expected to fail in shear. If any part of a circle crosses this line, it indicates that the corresponding stress combination exceeds the rock strength.  
By **examining** these circles, it is possible to assess how **close** the **formation** is to **failure** and identify whether a specific stress direction (e.g., tangential around the wellbore) is driving the instability. This is critical for **wellbore stability analysis**, casing design, and planning mud weight to **avoid collapse** or fracturing during drilling.
